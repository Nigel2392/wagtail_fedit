## Revisions

Revision support is included out of the box.
If your model inherits from a `RevisionMixin`, we will automatically create drafts for you.
These will not be published (If the model inherits from `DraftStateMixin`) until you choose to do so.

## Workflows

We include a `WorkFlow` to submit this object for moderation.

More workflow support will be included in the future.

## Logs

Logs are also included out of the box.
We will automatically update your model's history; including possible revisions.
This will allow you to backtrack each change made on the frontend.
This however does mean that a possibly large amount of data will be stored in your database.
